# FAO on GitHub

Welcome to the FAO GitHub. Best Practices repository! This project, guidelines, and resources are designed to help teams embed security into every stage of their DevOps lifecycle. Our goal is to drive secure, reliable, and compliant development practices in support of FAO’s global mandate.

## Our Mission

At FAO, our mission is to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural development by integrating robust security practices into our technology and operations. By adopting a “security by design” mindset, we strive to:

- **Embed Security Early:** Integrate security considerations from the planning phase.
- **Automate Testing:** Leverage automated security testing and vulnerability scanning.
- **Ensure Continuous Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring and logging for threat detection.
- **Promote Collaboration:** Encourage cross-team dialogue and shared responsibility for security.
- **Maintain Compliance:** Adhere to industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Best Practices Overview

This repository is informed by industry-leading DevSecOps practices. Key principles include:

- **Security by Design:** Secure architecture and threat modeling from the start.
- **Automated Security Testing:** Integrate static analysis, dependency scanning, and dynamic testing into your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Apply security best practices to code-managed infrastructure.
- **Container & Cloud Security:** Implement robust measures for container orchestration and cloud environments.
- **Incident Response:** Develop clear protocols for monitoring, logging, and reacting to potential threats.
- **Collaboration & Continuous Improvement:** Engage in ongoing dialogue via our wiki, discussions, and Q&A forums to keep pace with evolving threats.
